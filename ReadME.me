This wizard generates design storms (Rainfall depth variation with time) given total storm depth or IDF curve.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two methods are implemented in the code:
  - SCS II Design storm
  - Alternating blocks frequency storm
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The SCS method requires inputs in the form of a total storm depth (int/float) and a storm duration.
a set of predefined storm durations are given to the user form which he chooses.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Aletrnating Blocks method requires an input IDF curve file in the format supplied in the two text files.
The user can define for this method the time when the peak of the rainfall occurs based on experience.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The output of this code is a file containing the temporal distribution of the storm in addition to graphical representation of the event.
